* Welcome to the best collection of emacs extensions ever

I'm collecting and customizing the perfect environment for python
developement, using the most beautiful emacs customization to obtain a
really modern and exciting (yet stable) way to edit text files.

** Installation

Put the emacs-for-python directory where you want (you may want to put it in .emacs.d directory), the add this line in your .emacs

: (load-file "/path/to/emacs-for-python/python-collection.el")

If the startup is too slow you can compile the emacs lisp files typing make inside the emacs-for-python directory
